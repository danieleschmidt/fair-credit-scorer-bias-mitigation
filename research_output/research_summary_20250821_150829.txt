EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
Total Experiments Conducted: 5
Statistically Significant Findings: 1
Research Duration: 5.6 seconds
Datasets Created: 5
Algorithms Tested: 3

NOVEL INSIGHTS DISCOVERED
-------------------------
1. Novel Insight: Fairness metrics improve with larger dataset sizes, suggesting sampling bias in small datasets
2. Novel Insight: Strong feature correlations with protected attributes significantly amplify algorithmic bias


METHODOLOGY
-----------
- Hypothesis Generation: Literature-based systematic approach
- Dataset Creation: Controlled synthetic data with bias injection
- Statistical Validation: Comparative analysis with significance testing
- Algorithms: logistic_regression, random_forest, svm

LIMITATIONS
-----------
- Synthetic data may not capture real-world complexity
- Limited to binary classification tasks
- Simplified statistical testing approach
- No external validation on real datasets


FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
--------------------------
- Extend to multi-class and regression problems
- Incorporate real-world datasets
- Implement advanced bias mitigation techniques
- Develop automated hypothesis generation from literature


DETAILED FINDINGS
-----------------
Algorithm Performance Rankings (by fairness):
- logistic_regression: avg violation = 0.0222
- random_forest: avg violation = 0.0330
- svm: avg violation = 0.0330
