## ðŸ“‹ Manual Setup Required

Due to GitHub App permission limitations, the following require manual setup:

### GitHub Actions Workflows
```bash
# Create these files manually in .github/workflows/:
- ci.yml                    # Main CI pipeline
- security.yml             # Security scanning  
- release.yml              # Release automation
- dependency-update.yml     # Automated dependency updates
```

### Repository Settings
```bash
# Enable in repository settings:
- Branch protection rules (main branch)
- Required status checks
- Dependency graph and Dependabot
- Secret scanning and push protection
- Code security and analysis features
```

### Secrets Configuration
```bash
# Add these secrets in repository settings:
GHCR_TOKEN=<github_token_with_packages_write>
CODECOV_TOKEN=<codecov_token>
COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY=<cosign_private_key> # Optional
COSIGN_PASSWORD=<cosign_password>       # Optional
```
