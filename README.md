Fair Credit Scorer: Bias Mitigation in Lending Models
This project aims to build a credit scoring model and explore techniques to identify and mitigate demographic bias. The goal is to develop a model that is not only accurate but also fair with respect to specified protected attributes.
Project Goals
Develop a baseline credit scoring model.
Implement and calculate fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds).
Apply at least one bias mitigation technique (e.g., re-weighting, adversarial debiasing, or a post-processing method).
Evaluate and compare the model's performance and fairness before and after mitigation.
Discuss the trade-offs between fairness and accuracy.
Tech Stack (Planned)
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
AIF360 or Fairlearn (for fairness metrics and mitigation algorithms)
Matplotlib / Seaborn
