# Code Review

## Overview
The feature branch under review (commit `b4bb89e`) introduces the
initial project scaffolding together with modules for data loading,
model training and evaluation. It also adds a command line entrypoint
and tests covering dataset generation, model training, evaluation and
CLI execution. The development plan and sprint board were updated to
reflect these tasks.

## Static Analysis
- `ruff`: no issues found.
- `bandit`: no security issues detected.

## Testing
- `pytest`: 27 tests passed with several warnings from
  `scikit-learn` regarding deprecated solver options.

## Architecture & Code Quality
- The package is installable via `pyproject.toml` with a console
  script `fairness-eval` mapping to the CLI module.
- Public API re-exports core functions from the package root for ease
  of use.
- Data loader generates a synthetic dataset if none is present and
  provides train/test splits.
- Baseline model uses logistic regression (`liblinear` solver by
  default). Bias mitigation techniques include sample reweighting,
  post-processing with `ThresholdOptimizer` and an exponentiated
  gradient approach.
- Evaluation pipeline computes extensive fairness metrics using
  `fairlearn` and supports cross-validation and JSON output.

## Compliance with Development Plan
The implementation aligns with the first epic of the development plan
("Develop a baseline credit scoring model"), providing dataset loading,
model training, evaluation and mitigation utilities. Future tasks for
additional documentation, testing expansions and release preparation
remain open.

## Recommendations
- Add explicit `ARCHITECTURE.md` describing project structure and
  design principles, as referenced in the repository instructions.
- Consider pinning dependency versions in `requirements.txt` to ensure
  reproducible installations.
- Investigate the `scikit-learn` deprecation warnings to ensure future
  compatibility.
