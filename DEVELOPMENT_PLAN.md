# Development Plan for Fair Credit Scorer

This plan outlines the steps required to build the project described in `README.md`. Each section contains a checklist of tasks to complete.

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Python environment and install dependencies (`scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `aif360` or `fairlearn`).
- [x] Create initial directory structure (`data/`, `notebooks/`, `src/`, `tests/`).
- [x] Add a template `requirements.txt` and `.gitignore`.

## 2. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- [x] Obtain or generate a credit dataset with a protected attribute (e.g., synthetic German Credit data).
- [x] Implement `src/data_loader_preprocessor.py` to load and clean the dataset.
- [x] Split data into training and testing sets; store processed data in `data/`.

## 3. Baseline Model
- [x] Implement `src/baseline_model.py` with a simple classifier (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree).
- [x] Train the baseline model and evaluate accuracy.

## 4. Fairness Metrics
- [x] Implement `src/fairness_metrics.py` to compute metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds.
- [x] Write unit tests in `tests/test_fairness_metrics.py` to validate metric calculations.

## 5. Bias Mitigation Techniques
- [x] Implement at least one mitigation approach in `src/bias_mitigator.py` (re-weighting, adversarial debiasing, or a post-processing method).
- [x] Integrate the mitigation method into the training pipeline.

## 6. Evaluation and Comparison
- [x] Create `src/evaluate_fairness.py` to run the baseline and mitigated models, outputting performance and fairness metrics.
- [x] Analyze the trade-offs between fairness and accuracy in a Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/fairness_exploration.ipynb`).

## 7. Documentation and Reporting
- [x] Document how to reproduce experiments in `README.md` or separate docs.
 - [x] Summarize findings and recommendations.
