# Development Plan

## Phase 1: Core Implementation
- [x] **Feature:** Develop a baseline credit scoring model.
- [x] **Feature:** Apply at least one bias mitigation technique (e.g., re-weighting, adversarial debiasing, or a post-processing method).
- [x] **Feature:** Evaluate and compare the model's performance and fairness before and after mitigation.
- [x] **Feature:** Discuss the trade-offs between fairness and accuracy.

## Phase 2: Testing & Hardening
- [x] **Testing:** Write unit tests for all feature modules.
- [x] **Testing:** Add integration tests for the API and data pipelines.
- [x] **Hardening:** Run security (`bandit`) and quality (`ruff`) scans and fix all reported issues.

## Phase 3: Documentation & Release
- [x] **Docs:** Create a comprehensive `API_USAGE_GUIDE.md` with endpoint examples.
- [x] **Docs:** Update `README.md` with final setup and usage instructions.
- [x] **Release:** Prepare `CHANGELOG.md` and tag the v1.0.0 release.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] **Feature:** Implement core application logic based on README description.
- [x] **Feature:** Develop a baseline credit scoring model.
- [x] **Feature:** Apply at least one bias mitigation technique.
- [x] **Feature:** Evaluate and compare the model's performance and fairness.
- [x] **Feature:** Discuss the trade-offs between fairness and accuracy.
- [x] **Testing:** Write unit tests for all feature modules and the pipeline.
- [x] **Hardening:** Run security (`bandit`) and quality (`ruff`) scans.
- [x] **Docs:** Provide detailed usage guide and update README.
