- **Impact**: High - Ensures future compatibility and removes 93 test warnings
- **Effort**: Low (2 hours)
- **Business Value**: 8/10 - Prevents future breaking changes
- **Risk Reduction**: 9/10 - Eliminates known compatibility risk
- **Time Criticality**: 7/10 - Will become critical with future sklearn updates

### 2. Improve test coverage to 85%+ (Score: 10)
- **Impact**: High - Current 72% coverage leaves critical paths untested
- **Effort**: Medium (4 hours)  
- **Business Value**: 7/10 - Increases confidence in deployments
- **Risk Reduction**: 9/10 - Catches bugs before production
- **Time Criticality**: 6/10 - Important for maintaining quality

### 3. Add input validation and error handling (Score: 9)
- **Impact**: High - Prevents runtime errors and improves user experience
- **Effort**: Medium (3 hours)
- **Business Value**: 8/10 - Improves robustness for production use
- **Risk Reduction**: 8/10 - Prevents crashes from invalid inputs
- **Time Criticality**: 5/10 - Important for production readiness

## Medium Priority Tasks (Priority Score: 5-7)

### 4. Add performance benchmarking (Score: 7)
- **Impact**: Medium - Enables monitoring of model performance over time
- **Effort**: Medium (4 hours)
- **Business Value**: 6/10 - Helps optimize resource usage
- **Risk Reduction**: 5/10 - Identifies performance regressions
- **Time Criticality**: 4/10 - Useful but not urgent

### 5. Implement data versioning/tracking (Score: 6)
- **Impact**: Medium - Improves reproducibility and auditability
- **Effort**: High (6 hours)
- **Business Value**: 7/10 - Critical for ML model governance
- **Risk Reduction**: 6/10 - Enables rollback and debugging
- **Time Criticality**: 5/10 - Becomes important as model evolves

### 6. Add configuration management (Score: 6)
- **Impact**: Medium - Makes the system more configurable
- **Effort**: Medium (3 hours)
- **Business Value**: 5/10 - Improves flexibility
- **Risk Reduction**: 4/10 - Reduces hardcoded values
- **Time Criticality**: 3/10 - Nice to have

## Low Priority Tasks (Priority Score: <5)

### 7. Add model explainability features (Score: 4)
- **Impact**: Medium - Helps understand model decisions
- **Effort**: High (8 hours)
- **Business Value**: 6/10 - Important for fairness analysis
- **Risk Reduction**: 3/10 - Not critical for core functionality
- **Time Criticality**: 2/10 - Future enhancement

### 8. Implement advanced bias mitigation techniques (Score: 3)
- **Impact**: High - Could improve fairness metrics
- **Effort**: Very High (12 hours)
- **Business Value**: 8/10 - Core to the project mission
- **Risk Reduction**: 2/10 - Existing techniques work
- **Time Criticality**: 2/10 - Research/experimental work

## Completed Recently
- ✅ Initial project scaffolding and core modules
- ✅ Baseline model training and evaluation
- ✅ Basic fairness metrics computation
- ✅ CLI interface and JSON output
- ✅ Unit and integration tests (72% coverage)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with ruff and bandit
- ✅ Documentation and usage guides

## Next Sprint Focus
**Primary Goal**: Address top 3 high-priority tasks to improve code quality and robustness.

**Target Outcomes**:
1. Zero deprecation warnings in test suite
2. 85%+ test coverage with comprehensive edge case testing
3. Robust input validation preventing runtime errors
4. Improved user experience with clear error messages

## Technical Debt Log
- Deprecation warnings from scikit-learn L-BFGS-B solver
- Missing input validation in data_loader_preprocessor.py
- Incomplete test coverage in architecture_review.py (24%)
- Hardcoded parameters in baseline_model.py
- Missing error handling for file I/O operations

## Architectural Debt
- No centralized configuration management
- Limited logging and monitoring capabilities
- No data pipeline versioning or lineage tracking
- Missing integration tests for end-to-end workflows
