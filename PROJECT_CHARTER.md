# Project Charter: Fair Credit Scorer Bias Mitigation

## Executive Summary

The Fair Credit Scorer Bias Mitigation project addresses the critical need for fair and unbiased credit scoring models in financial services while demonstrating modern DevSecOps practices through autonomous repository management.

## Problem Statement

Traditional credit scoring models often exhibit demographic bias, leading to unfair lending decisions that disproportionately affect protected groups. This creates legal, ethical, and business risks for financial institutions while limiting access to credit for underserved populations.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Development of bias-aware credit scoring models
- Implementation of multiple fairness metrics and mitigation techniques
- Comprehensive evaluation framework for fairness vs. accuracy trade-offs
- Autonomous DevSecOps repository hygiene automation
- End-to-end ML pipeline with monitoring and observability
- Security-first development practices and compliance frameworks

### Out of Scope
- Production deployment to live credit systems
- Real customer data processing
- Regulatory compliance certification
- Commercial licensing or distribution

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Fairness Achievement**: Reduce demographic parity difference by >50% while maintaining >75% of baseline accuracy
2. **Technical Excellence**: Achieve >90% test coverage with comprehensive documentation
3. **Automation Maturity**: Implement fully autonomous DevSecOps pipeline with SLSA Level 3 compliance
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Create reproducible reference implementation for bias mitigation

### Key Performance Indicators
- Model accuracy: >80% on test dataset
- Equalized odds difference: <0.15
- Demographic parity ratio: >0.8
- Test coverage: >90%
- Documentation completeness: 100% of public APIs
- Security scan results: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
