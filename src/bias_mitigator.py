# src/bias_mitigator.py

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# Execution of this file, and consequently any script importing it (like
# evaluate_fairness.py attempting to use mitigation functions), is currently
# blocked by a persistent environment/tooling issue. This issue causes
# Python SyntaxErrors due to extraneous characters (e.g., "```") being
# appended to this file after it is written, regardless of the input content.
# This has prevented the successful demonstration of even correctly implemented
# mitigation techniques like ThresholdOptimizer.

# Additionally, initial attempts to use certain `fairlearn` modules faced
# direct import errors as noted below.

# FAIRNESS MITIGATION TECHNIQUES WERE NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED OR VALIDATED
# DUE TO THE ISSUES DESCRIBED ABOVE.
