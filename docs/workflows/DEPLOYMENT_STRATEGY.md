# Deployment Strategy

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Fair Credit Scorer system, including environment management, rollback procedures, and monitoring strategies.

## Overview

The Fair Credit Scorer uses a multi-environment deployment strategy with automated testing, gradual rollouts, and comprehensive monitoring to ensure reliable and safe deployments.

## Deployment Environments

### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Feature development and initial testing
- **Access**: Development team
- **Data**: Synthetic and anonymized data
- **Deployment**: Continuous deployment from feature branches
- **Monitoring**: Basic application metrics

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Integration testing and user acceptance testing
- **Access**: Development team, QA, stakeholders
- **Data**: Production-like synthetic data
- **Deployment**: Automated from main branch after CI passes
- **Monitoring**: Full monitoring stack with alerting

### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live system serving real users
- **Access**: Restricted to operations team
- **Data**: Real production data with privacy controls
- **Deployment**: Controlled releases with approval gates
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring with SLA tracking

## Deployment Pipeline

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Continuous Integration
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt

        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### 2. Continuous Deployment (CD)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/cd.yml
name: Continuous Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    tags: ['v*']

jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        run: |
          docker build -t fair-credit-scorer:staging .
          docker push $REGISTRY/fair-credit-scorer:staging
          kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/
  
  deploy-production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    needs: deploy-staging
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: |
          docker build -t fair-credit-scorer:${{ github.ref_name }} .
          docker push $REGISTRY/fair-credit-scorer:${{ github.ref_name }}
          kubectl apply -f k8s/production/
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Approach**: Maintain two identical production environments
- **Benefits**: Zero-downtime deployments, instant rollback
- **Implementation**: 
  - Deploy new version to inactive environment
  - Run health checks and smoke tests
  - Switch traffic to new environment
  - Keep old environment as backup

### Canary Deployment
- **Approach**: Gradual rollout to subset of users
- **Benefits**: Risk mitigation, performance monitoring
- **Implementation**:
  - Deploy to small percentage of traffic (5%)
  - Monitor key metrics for 30 minutes
  - Gradually increase traffic (25%, 50%, 100%)
  - Automatic rollback on metric degradation

### Rolling Deployment
- **Approach**: Update instances one by one
- **Benefits**: Resource efficient, gradual rollout
- **Implementation**:
  - Update 25% of instances at a time
  - Wait for health checks to pass
  - Continue with next batch
  - Maintain service availability throughout

            memory: 1Gi
          limits:
            cpu: 1000m
            memory: 2Gi
        livenessProbe:

            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
```

### Terraform Configuration
```hcl
# infrastructure/main.tf
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "main" {
  name = "fair-credit-scorer-${var.environment}"
  
  setting {
    name  = "containerInsights"
    value = "enabled"
  }
}

resource "aws_ecs_service" "api" {
  name            = "fair-credit-scorer-api"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.main.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.api.arn
  desired_count   = var.api_count
  
  deployment_configuration {
    maximum_percent         = 200
    minimum_healthy_percent = 100
  }
  
  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.api.arn
    container_name   = "api"
    container_port   = 8000
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Checks
- **Liveness Probe**: Basic application health
- **Readiness Probe**: Service readiness to accept traffic
- **Startup Probe**: Application startup validation

### Key Metrics
- **Application Metrics**:
  - Request rate and latency
  - Error rate and types
  - Prediction accuracy
  - Bias detection alerts

- **Infrastructure Metrics**:
  - CPU and memory utilization
  - Network I/O
  - Disk usage
  - Container restart count

### Alerting Rules
```yaml
# monitoring/alerts.yaml
groups:
- name: fair-credit-scorer
  rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.1
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: High error rate detected
  
  - alert: BiasDetected
    expr: bias_detection_alerts_total > 0
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: Bias detection alert triggered
  
  - alert: ModelDrift
    expr: model_drift_score > 0.1
    for: 10m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: Model drift detected
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- Latency p99 > 2 seconds for 5 minutes
- Memory usage > 90% for 10 minutes
- Bias detection alerts

### Manual Rollback Process
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   ```bash
   # Kubernetes rollback
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/fair-credit-scorer
   
   # Docker Swarm rollback
   docker service rollback fair-credit-scorer
   
   # Traffic switch (Blue-Green)
   kubectl patch service fair-credit-scorer -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"blue"}}}'
   ```

2. **Verification Steps**:
   - Check application health endpoints
   - Verify error rates return to baseline
   - Confirm bias detection systems are operational
   - Validate data pipeline integrity

3. **Post-Rollback Actions**:
   - Document incident and root cause
   - Update deployment procedures if needed
   - Plan fix and re-deployment strategy

## Security Considerations

### Container Security
- Use minimal base images
- Run as non-root user
- Implement resource limits
- Regular security scanning

### Secrets Management
- Use Kubernetes secrets or external secret managers
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Implement least-privilege access
- Audit secret access

### Network Security
- Implement network policies
- Use TLS for all communications
- Restrict ingress/egress traffic
- Monitor network activity

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Allocation
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 500m      # Half a CPU core
    memory: 1Gi    # 1 GB RAM
  limits:
    cpu: 1000m     # One CPU core
    memory: 2Gi    # 2 GB RAM
```

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: fair-credit-scorer-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: fair-credit-scorer
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- **Database Backups**: Daily automated backups with 30-day retention
- **Model Artifacts**: Versioned storage in S3 with cross-region replication
- **Configuration**: Git-based configuration management
- **Logs**: Centralized logging with long-term retention

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Data Recovery**:
   - Restore from latest backup
   - Validate data integrity
   - Replay transaction logs if needed

2. **Service Recovery**:
   - Deploy to alternate region/cluster
   - Restore configuration and secrets
   - Validate service functionality
   - Update DNS/load balancer

3. **Testing**:
   - Regular disaster recovery drills
   - Automated recovery testing
   - Documentation updates
   - Team training

## Compliance and Auditing

### Deployment Auditing
- All deployments logged with user, timestamp, and changes
- Git commit tracking for all configuration changes
- Approval workflows for production deployments
- Rollback tracking and justification

### Security Auditing
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Compliance checks (SOC 2, PCI DSS)
- Access control auditing
- Security incident response
