# Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines performance optimization strategies and automated monitoring for the fair-credit-scorer-bias-mitigation project.

## Automated Performance Monitoring

The project includes automated performance profiling tools to continuously monitor and optimize performance:

### Performance Profiler (`performance_profile.py`)

**Capabilities:**
- Function-level performance profiling with cProfile
- Memory usage tracking with tracemalloc
- CPU utilization monitoring
- Performance regression detection
- Automated optimization recommendations

**Usage:**
```bash
# Profile key modules automatically
python performance_profile.py

# Profile specific function
python -c "
from performance_profile import PerformanceProfiler
profiler = PerformanceProfiler()
# Your profiling code here
"
```

**Generated Reports:**
- JSON report with detailed metrics
- HTML visualization dashboard
- Performance trend charts
- Bottleneck identification

### Key Performance Metrics

1. **Execution Time**: Total and per-function timing
2. **Memory Usage**: Peak memory consumption and timeline
3. **Function Calls**: Call count and frequency analysis
4. **CPU Utilization**: Processor usage during execution

## Performance Optimization Strategies

def memory_intensive_function():
    # Function implementation
    pass
```

### 3. I/O Optimization

**File Operations:**

### Performance Testing

**Automated Tests:**
```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
python -m pytest tests/performance/ -v --benchmark-only

# Generate performance report
python performance_profile.py
```

**Continuous Monitoring:**
- Performance regression tests in CI/CD
- Automated alerts for performance degradation
- Historical performance tracking
- Resource usage monitoring

## Optimization Workflow

### 1. Identify Bottlenecks
```bash
# Profile current performance
python performance_profile.py

# Analyze tech debt impact
python tech_debt_monitor.py
```

### 2. Implement Optimizations
- Profile before changes
- Implement targeted optimizations
- Profile after changes
- Document performance improvements

### 3. Validate Improvements
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Compare performance metrics
- Verify functionality is unchanged
- Update performance benchmarks

### 4. Monitor Regression
- Set up performance alerts
- Regular performance audits
- Automated performance testing
- Performance trend analysis

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Profiling Integration

**Code Instrumentation:**
```python
from performance_profile import PerformanceProfiler

@profile_function
def critical_function():
    # Implementation
    pass
```

**Custom Metrics:**
```python
# Track custom performance metrics
profiler = PerformanceProfiler()
with profiler.measure_context("custom_operation"):
    # Your operation here
    pass
```

### 2. Resource Management

**Memory Management:**
- Monitor memory leaks
- Optimize garbage collection
- Use memory pools
- Profile memory allocation patterns

**CPU Optimization:**
- Multi-threading for I/O bound tasks
- Multi-processing for CPU bound tasks
- Asyncio for concurrent operations
- CPU affinity optimization

### 3. Caching Strategies

**Function-Level Caching:**
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def expensive_computation(param):
    # Expensive operation
    return result
```

**Data Caching:**
- Redis for distributed caching
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- File-based caching for computed results
- Cache invalidation strategies

## Performance Monitoring Dashboard

The automated performance profiling generates:

1. **Real-time Metrics**: Current performance status
2. **Historical Trends**: Performance over time
3. **Bottleneck Analysis**: Slow functions identification
4. **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU consumption
5. **Optimization Recommendations**: Automated suggestions

## Integration with CI/CD

**Performance Gates:**
- Fail builds on significant performance regression
- Generate performance reports on each commit
- Compare performance against baseline
- Alert on performance threshold violations

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# Example performance gate configuration
performance_thresholds:
  max_execution_time: 60  # seconds
  max_memory_usage: 1024  # MB
  max_regression: 20      # percent
```

## Best Practices

1. **Profile First**: Always profile before optimizing
2. **Measure Impact**: Quantify optimization benefits
3. **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure optimizations don't break features
4. **Document Changes**: Record optimization decisions and results
5. **Monitor Continuously**: Set up ongoing performance monitoring
