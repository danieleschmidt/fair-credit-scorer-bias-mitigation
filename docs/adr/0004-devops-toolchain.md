# ADR-0004: DevOps Toolchain Selection

## Status

Accepted

Date: 2025-01-27

## Context

The project requires a comprehensive DevOps toolchain to support:

- Automated testing and quality assurance
- Security scanning and compliance
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Repository hygiene and maintenance
- Code quality and formatting standards
- Dependency management and updates

The choice of toolchain affects development velocity, security posture, and maintenance overhead. Given the financial ML nature of the project, security and compliance are critical requirements.

## Decision

We will use a **Python-native toolchain** with GitHub-integrated DevOps practices:

**Core Tools:**
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage reporting
- **Linting**: Ruff (replaces flake8, isort, etc.)
- **Formatting**: Black
- **Security**: Bandit + pre-commit hooks
- **Type Checking**: mypy
- **Dependency Management**: pip-tools + Dependabot
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions + custom repo hygiene bot

**Package Management:**
- **Build System**: setuptools with pyproject.toml
- **Environment**: venv + pip (Docker for deployment)
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commits

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Poetry-based Toolchain
- **Description**: Use Poetry for dependency management and packaging
- **Pros**: 
  - Unified dependency and build management
  - Better dependency resolution
  - Virtual environment management
  - Lock file support
- **Cons**: 
  - Additional tool complexity
  - Potential CI/CD integration challenges
  - Learning curve for team members
  - Less compatibility with some deployment scenarios
- **Reason for rejection**: Standard pip-tools approach provides sufficient functionality

### Alternative 2: conda/mamba Ecosystem
- **Description**: Use conda for package and environment management
- **Pros**: 
  - Better handling of scientific Python dependencies
  - Cross-platform consistency
  - Binary package distribution
- **Cons**: 
  - Slower dependency resolution
  - Larger download sizes
  - Less standard in production environments
  - Additional complexity for CI/CD
- **Reason for rejection**: pip-based approach simpler for pure Python project

### Alternative 3: Enterprise Tools (Jenkins, SonarQube, etc.)
- **Description**: Use enterprise-grade DevOps tools
- **Pros**: 
  - Advanced features and integrations
  - Enterprise support and SLAs
  - Sophisticated reporting and analytics
- **Cons**: 
  - High cost and complexity
  - Overkill for project size
  - Vendor lock-in risks
  - Infrastructure management overhead
- **Reason for rejection**: GitHub-native approach more cost-effective

## Consequences

### Positive
- Native GitHub integration reduces complexity
- Python-focused toolchain with minimal external dependencies
- Strong security scanning and automation capabilities
- Established best practices and community support
- Cost-effective for open source project

### Negative
- Manual coordination required between multiple tools
- Some advanced features require custom implementation
- Dependency on GitHub ecosystem

### Neutral
- Standard Python development practices
- Easy onboarding for Python developers
- Compatible with most deployment environments

## Implementation

1. **Core Configuration Files**:
   - `pyproject.toml`: Unified Python project configuration
   - `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Quality gate automation
   - `tox.ini`: Multi-environment testing
   - `Makefile`: Standardized command interface

2. **GitHub Integration**:
   - GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
   - Dependabot for dependency updates
   - Repository hygiene bot for automated maintenance

3. **Quality Gates**:
   - Pre-commit hooks for immediate feedback
   - CI pipeline for comprehensive validation
   - Automated security scanning and reporting

4. **Documentation**:
   - MkDocs for project documentation
   - ADRs for architectural decisions
   - Inline code documentation standards

## Notes

This toolchain prioritizes simplicity and GitHub integration over advanced enterprise features. The approach can be enhanced with additional tools as project requirements evolve, while maintaining the core Python-native philosophy.
