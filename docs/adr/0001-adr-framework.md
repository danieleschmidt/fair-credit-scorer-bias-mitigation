# ADR-0001: ADR Framework Implementation

## Status

Accepted

Date: 2025-01-27

## Context

The fair-credit-scorer-bias-mitigation project has grown in complexity with multiple architectural decisions being made without formal documentation. As the project evolves and team members join, there's a need to:

- Document architectural decisions and their rationale
- Provide historical context for future maintainers
- Establish a systematic approach to decision-making
- Enable better collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Support compliance and audit requirements for financial ML systems

The project deals with sensitive financial data and bias mitigation, making architectural transparency crucial for regulatory compliance and ethical AI practices.

## Decision

We will implement Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) using the format proposed by Michael Nygard, stored in the `docs/adr/` directory of the project repository.

Key aspects of our ADR implementation:
- Use sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.)
- Store as Markdown files for version control integration
- Include status tracking (Proposed → Accepted → Superseded/Deprecated)
- Require ADRs for significant architectural decisions
- Integrate ADR review into the pull request process

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Confluence/Wiki Documentation
- **Description**: Use external wiki system for architectural documentation
- **Pros**: Rich formatting, better search, collaborative editing
- **Cons**: Separate from code repository, versioning challenges, access control complexity
- **Reason for rejection**: Breaks the "docs as code" principle and creates silos

### Alternative 2: Code Comments Only
- **Description**: Document architectural decisions directly in code comments
- **Pros**: Close to implementation, always up-to-date
- **Cons**: Poor discoverability, no historical context, limited context space
- **Reason for rejection**: Insufficient for complex architectural decisions

### Alternative 3: Meeting Minutes/Design Docs
- **Description**: Continue with informal documentation in meeting notes
- **Pros**: Natural conversation flow, familiar process
- **Cons**: Poor searchability, inconsistent format, scattered information
- **Reason for rejection**: Lacks structure and systematic approach

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural rationale for future reference
- Improved onboarding for new team members
- Better decision-making through structured analysis
- Enhanced compliance documentation for financial ML regulations
- Version control integration provides change history

### Negative
- Additional overhead for architectural decisions
- Requires discipline to maintain
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with ADRs

### Neutral
- ADRs become part of the definition of done for architectural changes
- Review process may slow down some decisions initially

## Implementation

1. Create `docs/adr/` directory structure
2. Establish ADR template based on Nygard format
3. Create initial ADRs for existing architectural decisions:
   - Fairness library choice (Fairlearn vs AIF360)
   - Bias mitigation approach selection
   - DevOps toolchain decisions
4. Update contributing guidelines to include ADR requirements
5. Add ADR review to pull request checklist

## Notes

This ADR itself serves as the first example of our ADR process. Future architectural decisions should follow this template and be numbered sequentially.
