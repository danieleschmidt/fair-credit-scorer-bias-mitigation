# ADR-0001: Use Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As the Fair Credit Scorer project grows in complexity, we need a systematic way to document architectural decisions. Team members need to understand the reasoning behind technical choices, and new contributors need context about why certain approaches were taken.

Key drivers:
- Knowledge preservation as team members change
- Transparent decision-making process
- Avoiding repeated debates on settled decisions
- Facilitating architectural reviews and compliance

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. ADRs will be:
- Stored in `docs/adr/` directory
- Written in Markdown using a consistent template
- Numbered sequentially starting with 0001
- Reviewed as part of the normal pull request process

## Consequences

### Positive
- Architectural decisions are explicitly documented and rationale preserved
- New team members can understand historical context
- Decisions can be revisited with full context
- Compliance and audit processes are supported
- Knowledge is preserved even as team composition changes

### Negative
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Risk of ADRs becoming stale if not maintained
- May slow down decision-making if over-applied to minor choices

### Neutral
- ADRs will be created for significant architectural decisions only
- Template provides consistent structure across all ADRs

## Related Decisions
This is the foundational ADR that enables all future architectural documentation.

## Notes
Template based on Michael Nygard's ADR format. Focus on architectural decisions that have lasting impact on the system structure, not implementation details.
