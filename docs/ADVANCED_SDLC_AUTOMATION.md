- 🎯 Risk assessment with mitigation strategies

**Usage**:
```bash
# Analyze release readiness
make release-readiness
python scripts/advanced_release_automation.py --analyze

# Suggest next version
python scripts/advanced_release_automation.py --suggest-version auto
```

**Output**: Generates `release_readiness.json` with comprehensive release analysis.

### 5. Intelligent Deployment Manager (`scripts/intelligent_deployment_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Advanced deployment automation with blue-green, canary, and rollback capabilities.

**Key Features**:
- 🎯 Multi-strategy deployments (blue-green, canary, rolling, recreate)
- 📊 Deployment readiness analysis with risk assessment
- 🔄 Automated rollback mechanisms with health validation
- 📈 Performance monitoring during deployments
- 📋 Comprehensive deployment history and analytics

**Usage**:
```bash
# Analyze deployment readiness
make deployment-analysis
python scripts/intelligent_deployment_manager.py --analyze staging

# Execute deployment
python scripts/intelligent_deployment_manager.py --deploy staging v1.2.0 canary

# Generate deployment report
python scripts/intelligent_deployment_manager.py --report
```

**Output**: Generates deployment analysis and maintains deployment history.

### 6. Observability Platform (`scripts/observability_platform.py`)

**Purpose**: Advanced monitoring and observability with intelligent alerting.

**Key Features**:
- 📊 Comprehensive metrics collection (system, application, pipeline)
- 🚨 Intelligent alerting with anomaly detection
- 🎯 SLI/SLO tracking for reliability monitoring
- 📈 Real-time dashboards and trend analysis
- 🔍 Performance insights and optimization recommendations

**Usage**:
```bash
# Generate observability report
make observability-report
python scripts/observability_platform.py --report

# Run monitoring cycle
python scripts/observability_platform.py --monitor

# Start continuous monitoring
python scripts/observability_platform.py --continuous --interval 30
```

**Output**: Generates comprehensive observability reports and real-time monitoring data.

## 🎯 Complete SDLC Health Check

Run the complete SDLC health check to analyze all aspects of your repository:

```bash
make sdlc-health-check
```

This command runs:
1. Dependency analysis
2. Security scan
3. Code review
4. Release readiness analysis

## 📊 Integration with Existing Tools

### Make Integration

All automation tools are integrated into the Makefile with convenient commands:

```bash
make dependency-analysis      # Dependency intelligence
make security-scan           # Security automation
make code-review            # AI code review
make release-readiness      # Release analysis
make deployment-analysis    # Deployment readiness
make observability-report   # Observability insights
make sdlc-health-check     # Complete analysis
```

### CI/CD Integration

These tools are designed to integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: SDLC Health Check
  run: |
    make dependency-analysis
    make security-scan
    make code-review
